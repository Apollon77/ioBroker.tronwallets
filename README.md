## Description of Adapter
This adapter allows you to read the TRON Wallet data using the trxplorer API. Any number of wallets can be read. Also, the current price of BTC and TRX is pulled by the Binance API.

## SAFETY NOTICE
Please NEVER enter the private key in the input fields but ONLY the public wallet addresses of the TRON network.

### Donate
Of course I would be happy about a small donation in the form of TRX to the following wallet address :-)
